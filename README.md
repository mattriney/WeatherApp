# WeatherApp

A full-stack weather app built in Angular. This project displays weather information for a home city obtained via the Open Weather Map API(through RapidAPI.) It also allows a user to search for a city of their choice in the search bar. The app will then retrieve and display the weather conditions for that location.

TODO:

Implement new API. Open Weather Map has been dropped from RapidAPI as of 7-28-22.

Dear Users,
 
We've been notified by the provider the APIs access had to be terminated due to cease and desist claim.
 
We are very sorry for such an abrupt change and poor experience. We searched for alternatives and you can find them here: https://rapidapi.com/search/weather or in one of our Collections: https://rapidapi.com/collection/top-weather-apis.
 
All the best,
The RapidAPI Team

Update background images.

Add error message/page if api call does not work(API seems to be somewhat unreliable.)

UI improvements(larger screens)
