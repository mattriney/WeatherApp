# WeatherApp

A full-stack weather app built in Angular. This project displays weather information for a home city obtained via the Open Weather Map API. It also allows a user to search for a city of their choice in the search bar. The app will then retrieve and display the weather conditions for that location.


TODO:

Add error message/page if api call does not work.
